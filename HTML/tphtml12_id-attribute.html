    The Id Attribute
    
    The id attribute of an HTML tag can be used to 
    uniquely identify any element within an HTML page. 
    There are two primary reasons that you might want 
    to use an id attribute on an element âˆ’

    > If an element carries an id attribute as a unique 
    identifier, it is possible to identify just that 
    element and its content.

    > If you have two elements of the same name within 
    a Web page (or style sheet), you can use the id 
    attribute to distinguish between elements that have 
    the same name.
