The title Attribute
The title attribute gives a suggested title for the element. 
They syntax for the title attribute is similar as explained 
for id attribute âˆ’

The behavior of this attribute will depend upon the element 
that carries it, although it is often displayed as a tooltip 
when cursor comes over the element or while the element is 
loading.

Now try to bring your cursor over "Titled Heading Tag Example" 
and you will see that whatever title you used in your code is 
coming out as a tooltip of the cursor.
