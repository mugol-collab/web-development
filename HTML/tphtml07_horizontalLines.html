<!--

Horizontal lines are used to visually break-up sections 
of  a document. The  <hr>  tag  creates a line from the 
current position in the document to the right margin and 
breaks the line accordingly.

<hr /> tag is an example of the empty element, where you 
do not need opening and closing tags, as there is nothing 
to go in between them.

The <hr /> element has a space between the characters hr 
and  the  forward slash.  If  you omit this space, older 
browsers will have trouble rendering the horizontal line, 
while if  you miss  the forward slash character and just 
use <hr> it is not valid in XHTML

For example, you may want to give a line between two 
paragraphs as in the given example below:

-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Horizontal Line Example</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>This is paragraph one and should be on top</p>
        <hr />
        <p>This is paragraph two and should be at bottom</p>
    </body>
</html>
