    The dir Attribute
    
    The dir attribute allows you to indicate to the browser 
    about the direction in which  the text should flow. The 
    dir attribute can take one of  two values,  as  you can 
    see in the table that follows 


    Value	Meaning
    ltr	    Left to right (the default value)
    rtl	    Right to left (for languages such as Hebrew 
            or Arabic that are read right to left)

    When dir attribute is used within the  <html>  tag, 
    it determines how text will be presented within the 
    entire document.  When used within another tag, it 
    controls the text's direction for just the content 
    of that tag.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html dir = "rtl">
    <head>
        <title>dir attribute</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>dir attribute</p>
        This is how IE 5 renders right-to-left directed text.
    </body>
</html>
