    The lang Attribute

    The lang attribute allows you to indicate the main 
    language used in a document, but this attribute was 
    kept in HTML only for backwards compatibility with 
    earlier versions of HTML. This  attribute has been 
    replaced by the xml:lang  attribute in  new  XHTML 
    documents.

    The values of the lang attribute are ISO-639 
    standard two-character language codes. Check 
    HTML Language Codes: ISO 639 for a complete 
    list of language codes.
