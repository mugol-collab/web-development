<!--

Whenever you use the <br /> element, anything following 
it starts from the next line. This tag is an example of 
an  empty  element,  where  you do not need opening and 
closing tags, as there is nothing to go in between them.

The <br /> tag has a space between the characters br and 
the forward slash. If you omit this space, older browsers 
will have trouble rendering the line break, while if you 
miss the forward slash character and just use <br> it is 
not valid in XHTML.
