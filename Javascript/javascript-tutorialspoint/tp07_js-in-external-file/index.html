<!-- As you begin to work more extensively with JavaScript, you will 
be likely to find that there are cases where you are reusing 
identical JavaScript code on multiple pages of a site.

You are not restricted to be maintaining identical code in 
multiple HTML files. The script tag provides a mechanism to 
allow you to store JavaScript in an external file and then 
include it into your HTML files.

Here is an example to show how you can include an external 
JavaScript file in your HTML code using script tag and its 
src attribute. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <script type = "text/javascript" src = "index.js">
        </script>
    </head>

    <body>
        <input type = "button" onclick = "sayHello()" value = "alert button"/>
    </body>
</html>
