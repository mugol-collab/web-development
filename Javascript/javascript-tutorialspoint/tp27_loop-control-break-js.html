<!--

    JavaScript provides full control to handle loops 
    and switch statements. There may be a situation 
    when you need to come out of a loop without 
    reaching its bottom

    The break Statement
    
    The break statement, which was briefly introduced 
    with the switch statement, is used to exit a loop 
    early, breaking out of the enclosing curly braces.

    Example
    
    The following example illustrates the use of a 
    break statement with a while loop. Notice how 
    the loop breaks out early once x reaches 5 and 
    reaches to document.write (..) statement just 
    below to the closing curly brace
