<!--

    The 'for' loop is the most compact form of looping. 
    It includes the following three important parts âˆ’

    The loop initialization where we initialize our 
    counter to a starting value. The initialization 
    statement  is  executed before the loop begins.

    The test statement which will test if a given 
    condition is true or not. If the condition is 
    true, then the code given inside the loop will 
    be executed, otherwise the control will come 
    out of the loop.

    The iteration statement where you can increase 
    or decrease your counter.

    You can put all the three parts in a single line 
    separated by semicolons.

    Syntax

    for (initialization; test condition; iteration statement) {
        Statement(s) to be executed if test condition is true
    }
