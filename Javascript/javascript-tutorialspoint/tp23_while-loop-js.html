    The while Loop

    The most basic loop in JavaScript is the while loop 
    which would be discussed in this chapter. The purpose 
    of a while loop is to execute a statement or code 
    block repeatedly as long as an expression is true. 
    Once the expression becomes false, the loop 
    terminates.  

    Syntax

    while (expression) {
        Statement(s) to be executed if expression is true
    }
