    JavaScript - Functions

    A function is a group  of reusable code which can be 
    called anywhere in your program. This eliminates the 
    need  of  writing  the same code again and again. It 
    helps programmers in writing modular codes. Functions 
    allow a programmer  to divide a  big  program into a 
    number of small and manageable functions.

    Function Definition

    Before we use a function, we need to define it. The 
    most common way to define a function in JavaScript 
    is by using the function keyword, followed by a 
    unique function name, a list of parameters (that 
    might be empty), and a statement block surrounded 
    by curly braces.

    Syntax

    <script type = "text/javascript">
      function functionname(parameter-list) {
         statements
    </script>

    <head>
        <script type = "text/javascript">
            function sayHello(){
                document.write("Hello there!")
            }
        </script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>Click the following button to call the functions</p>
        <form>
            <input type = "button" onclick = "sayHello()" value = "Say Hello">
        </form>
    </body>
