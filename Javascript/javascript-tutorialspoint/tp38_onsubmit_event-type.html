    JavaScript - Events

    When the page loads, it is called an event. When the 
    user clicks a button, that click too is an event. 
    Other examples include events like pressing any key, 
    closing a window, resizing a window, etc.

    onsubmit Event Type

    onsubmit is an event that occurs when you try to submit 
    a form. You can put your form validation against this 
    event type.

    The following example shows how to use onsubmit. Here we 
    are calling a validate() function before submitting a 
    form data to the webserver. If validate() function 
    returns true, the form will be submitted, otherwise it 
    will not submit the data.

                . . . . . . . . .
                return either true or false
            }
