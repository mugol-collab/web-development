JavaScript supports the following types of operators.

> Arithmetic Operators
    + (Addition), - (Subtraction), * (Multiplication),
    / (Division), % (Modulus), ++ (Increment), -- (Decrement)

> Comparison Operators
    = = (Equal), != (Not Equal), > (Greater than), < (Less than)
    >= (Greater than or Equal to), <= (Less than or Equal to)


> Logical (or Relational) Operators
    && (Logical AND): If both the operands are non-zero, condition true.
    || (Logical OR) :  If any of the two operands are non-zero, condition true
    ! (Logical NOT) :  Reverses the logical state of its operand

> Bitwise operators
    & (Bitwise AND): Performs a Boolean AND operation on each bit of its integer arguments 
    | (BitWise OR) : Performs a Boolean OR operation on each bit of its integer arguments
    ^ (Bitwise XOR): Performs a Boolean exclusive OR operation on each bit of its integer 
                     arguments. (Exclusive OR means that either operand one is true or 
                     operand two is true, but not both)
    ~ (Bitwise Not): It is a unary operator and operates by reversing all the bits in the 
                     operand.
    << (Left Shift): It moves all the bits in its first operand to the left by the number 
                     of places specified in the second operand. New bits are filled with zeros.
                     Shifting a value left by one position is equivalent to multiplying it by 2, 
                     shifting two positions is equivalent to multiplying by 4, and so on.
    >> (Right Shift): Binary Right Shift Operator. The left operand’s value is moved right by 
                      the number of bits specified by the right operand
    >>> (Right shift with Zero): This operator is just like the >> operator, except that the 
                                 bits shifted in on the left are always zero

> Assignment Operators
    = (Simple Assignment), 	+= (Add and Assignment), −= (Subtract and Assignment), 
    *= (Multiply and Assignment), /= (Divide and Assignment), %= (Modules and Assignment)

> Miscellaneus Operators

    Conditional (or ternary) Operators (?:) and the typeof operator

    ?: (Conditional) ->  If Condition is true? Then value X : Otherwise value Y

    typeof : the typeof operator is a unary operator that is placed before its single 
             operand, which can be of any type. Its value is a string indicating the 
             data type of the operand.
             The typeof operator evaluates to "number", "string", or "boolean" if its 
             operand is a number, string, or boolean value and returns true or false 
             based on the evaluation.
