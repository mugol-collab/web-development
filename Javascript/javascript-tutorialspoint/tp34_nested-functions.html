    JavaScript - Nested Functions

    Prior to JavaScript 1.2, function definition was allowed 
    only in top level global code, but JavaScript 1.2 allows 
    function definitions to be nested within other functions 
    as well. Still there is a restriction that function 
    definitions may not appear within loops or conditionals. 
    These restrictions on function definitions apply only to 
    function declarations with the function statement.

    As we'll discuss later in the next chapter, function 
    literals (another feature introduced in JavaScript 1.2) 
    may appear within any JavaScript expression, which means 
    that they can appear within if and other statements.
