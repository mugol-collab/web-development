<!--
    The for...in loop is used to loop through an object's 
    properties. As we have not discussed Objects yet, you 
    may not feel comfortable with this loop. But once you 
    understand how objects behave in JavaScript, you will 
    find this loop very useful.

    Syntax

    for (variablename in object) {
        statement or block to execute
    }
