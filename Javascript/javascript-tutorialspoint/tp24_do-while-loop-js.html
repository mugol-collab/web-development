<!--

    The do...while loop  is  similar to the while loop 
    except that the condition check happens at the end 
    of the loop. This means  that the loop will always 
    be executed at least once, even if the condition is 
    false. 

    Syntax
    
    do {
        Statement(s) to be executed;
    } while (expression);
